# MLExchange Model Registry
Model registry and its API for the MLExchange platform.


## How to use
**Running model registry**   
`docker-compose up --build`

**Viewing the existing models**  
Scroll down to the bottom of the page, click on **Refresh** button.

**Delete the existing models**  
Select models from the table and click **Delete** button.

**Modify the existing models**  
Currently, the **Modify** button is restricted to limited information items. 
Therefore, the easiest way to modify an existing registration is to delete the model, then upload the changed JSON document again (drag and drop, click **Validate** button first, then click the **Upload** button).
